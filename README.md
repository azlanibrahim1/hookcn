> **hookcn** started as a personal tool. Now it‚Äôs open for everyone. It lets you copy TypeScript React hooks directly into your codebase ‚Äî no dependencies, full ownership.

<br>

## üõ† Getting Started

Install the CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g hookcn
```

> [!TIP]
> You can then run commands using `hookcn`, `hcn`, or `use-hook-cli`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### Step 1: Initialize the Config

```bash
npx hookcn init
```

This creates a `hooks.json` file at your project root:

```json
{
  "destination": "src/hooks"
}
```

This tells the CLI where to place downloaded hooks. You can update it anytime.

### Step 2: Add a Hook

List available hooks from the registry:

```bash
npx hookcn list
```

Install a hook by name:

```bash
npx hookcn add <hook-name>
```

The hook will be copied into the directory defined in `hooks.json` (default: `src/hooks/`).
